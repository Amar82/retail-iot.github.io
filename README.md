## Overview of the Solution - The Story

To start with I will describe the intended solution & the initial architecture that we have in mind.
Retail is a fast moving industry and consumers have a negative sentiment about products which are not kept in proper storage condition &amp; which are about to expire or already expired. The products which are improperly stored &amp; are close to expiry or has expired are not sold. This not only means lost sales but also negative consumer sentiment on the store, on the product &amp; on the Brand as a whole.

The manual effort needed to solve this problem will be too laborious, prone to human error and lacks transparency &amp; visibility to the product/brand owner level. The solution we are proposing will use IOT based technology to solves these problems
