Overview of the Solution - The Story

Retail is a fast moving industry and consumers have a negative sentiment about products which are not kept in proper storage condition
& which are about to expire or already expired. The products which are improperly stored &amp; are close to expiry
or has expired are not sold. This not only means lost sales but also negative consumer
sentiment on the store, on the product & on the Brand as a whole.

The manual effort needed to solve this problem will be too laborious, prone to human error and lacks transparency & 
visibility to the product/brand owner level.

The solution we are proposing will use IOT based technology to solves these problems
